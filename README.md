# Weather-Forecasting-using-LSTM-and-RNN
This project is on Weather Forecasting using LSTM and RNN (Deep Learning Techniques).
This project leverages Deep Learning techniques (LSTM & RNN) to predict weather conditions based on historical meteorological data. 
By utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the model captures temporal dependencies in time-series weather data, improving the accuracy of future weather predictions.
